# Laikata - A CanSat project
 
Our goal is to build a can-sized autonomous vehicle that is capable of guiding itself towards a GPS location once launched from 1km high on the sky.

Here you have some documents, but not any code. The code is split in other repositories:

- [Software](https://github.com/Laikata/Software)
  - The code that goes on "the thing"
  - Developed in C and C++ using arduino framework on PlatformIO
